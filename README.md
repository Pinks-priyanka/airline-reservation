# airline-reservation
The main objective of the python project on Air
ticket reservation is to manage the details of
booking, payments, seats, and flights. The purpose
of the project is to build an application program to
reduce the manual work for managing the booking,
discounts, seats, and payments.

Airline reservation systems are part of the so-
calledpassenger service systems, which are
applications supporting the direct contact with the
passenger. Airlines reservation system eventually
evolved into the computer reservations system. A
computer reservation system is used for the
reservations of a particular airline and interfaces
with aglobal distribution system which supports
travel agencies and other distribution channels in
making reservations for most major airlines in a
single system.
